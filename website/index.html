        <p>Do not go gentle into that good night<br>
            <em>Dylan Thomas<br>
                1914 – 1953</em></p>

        <p>Do not go gentle into that good night,<br>
            Old age should burn and rave at close of day;<br>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

        <p>Though wise men at their end know dark is right,<br>
            Because their words had forked no lightning they<br>
            Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

        <p>Good men, the last wave by, crying how bright<br>
            Their frail deeds might have danced in a green bay,<br>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

        <p>Wild men who caught and sang the sun in flight,<br>
            And learn, too late, they grieved it on its way,<br>
            Do not go gentle into that good night.</p>

        <p>Grave men, near death, who see with blinding sight<br>
            Blind eyes could blaze like meteors and be gay,<br>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>

        <p>And you, my father, there on the sad height,<br>
            Curse, bless, me now with your fierce tears, I pray.<br>
            Do not go gentle into that good night.<br>
            Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
